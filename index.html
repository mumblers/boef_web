                    In this mode you are a robber that tries to escape the neighbourhood. But be aware... There are sensors everywhere!
                    Keep out of sight of camera's and reach a green finish flag to escape the police. Your results will
                    be tracked to help the police find the sensor setup that catches the most bad guys!

                    In this mode you take the place of a police officer that is tasked with placing cameras and audio sensors
                    in a real neighbourhood. You should use as few resources as possible to minimal your spending. So make sure
                    your sensors are on positions that have the most impact! Other players can playtest your map to see if
                    your setup is realy the best.

                    In this mode you can select your neigbourhood and setup police resources the way you see fit.
                    You can place camera's at places that you beleve need more monitoring. Or you can configure audio sensors
                    at places where there is a lot of noise pollution. It's all up to you! Your configuration will help the police
                    to make choises about resource allocation in your neighbourhood.
